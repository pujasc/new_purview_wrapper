## INTRODUCTION - Microsoft Purview Governance Wrapper (Unified Catalog)
An unofficial Python wrapper for Microsoft Purview Data Governance's Unified Catalog API. 

## 📖 Context & Motivation
I started this project while leading Data Governance implementations for major Consumer & Goods (C&G) enterprises.

With the release of the "New" Microsoft Purview (Unified Catalog), there has been a significant paradigm shift in how we architect data estates. We have moved away from a Centralized, IT-led Data Map to a Federated, Business-led Governance model.The goal now is to not only provide a platform for data governance but also to drive business value creation in your organization.

However, for developers and architects, this shift created confusion:
* "Do I still use the Apache Atlas APIs?"
* "How do I programmatically create a Data Product?"
* "Why does my old lineage code look different in the new portal?"

This repository is my attempt to streamline and document these learnings. It serves as a Python wrapper that abstracts the complexity of the underlying APIs, helping you build for the future of governance rather than just the technical past.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a personal project. This code is based on my personal learnings and experiments with the platform. It is not an official Microsoft product, nor is it an official release from my employer. This is a community-driven effort to make the Purview developer experience better for everyone.

## 🤝 Contributing
Documentation and examples are just as valuable as code! If you are figuring out how to map "Glossary Terms" to "Data Products" programmatically, please open a PR or an Issue to share your findings.
